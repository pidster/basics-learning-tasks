# The Basics

## Storing and building code

Source code is text files containing programming language statements. These files are stored in a Version Control System (VCS), which keeps an historical record of the line-by-line changes in each file stored in the VCS.

### Git!

(This is not an admonishment.) Git is Distributed VCS (don't worry about the Distributed bit for now) - and GitHub is a service that provides it. [Use the GitHub learning resources](https://try.github.io/) to learn how to use Git. Some key terms to learn and understand are 'clone', 'commit', 'push', 'merge' and 'rebase'.

    Task: Add a link to an online tutorial that you have enjoyed, and add yourself to the contributors file.		

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your copy of the repository
3. Add a tutorial link to [Useful-Tutorials.md](./Useful-Tutorials.md)
4. Add your name to the [Contributors.md](./Contributors.md) file.
5. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository (this one!)

### CI

Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of merging new source code into the main code base at least once per day.
